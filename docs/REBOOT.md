# REBOOT.md — Session Continuity Script

Machine-readable state snapshot for isd-bus-routing. **Read this first**
when resuming work in a new session/branch after a context reset. Not
user-facing documentation — see README.md and docs/architecture.md for
that. Update this file after every merged increment (committed directly
to `main`, not through the branch→PR→CI cycle used for everything else —
this is a living operational document, not a feature).

## Identity / non-negotiable conventions

- Sole author/dev: Gideon Mpungu (gmbugampungu@gmail.com). **Every**
  commit authored as "Gideon Mpungu". Never add other
  contributors/co-authors.
- Git: **local** (repo-scoped, not `--global`) `user.name="Gideon Mpungu"`
  already set on this checkout. GitHub account: `giddy-mpungu`. Repo:
  https://github.com/giddy-mpungu/isd-bus-routing (private).
- Workflow: one branch per feature → PR via `gh` CLI → CI must pass →
  `gh pr merge --merge --delete-branch` → sync local `main`. Followed
  for every PR this session (11 so far) with two accidental exceptions
  where a commit was made directly on `main` before remembering to
  branch first (caught before pushing both times — fixed by
  `git branch <name>` at the current commit, `git reset --hard
  origin/main`, then `git checkout <name>` and pushing that instead;
  safe only because `origin/main` was confirmed to be a strict
  ancestor of local `main` first). **Always run `git checkout -b
  <branch>` as the literal first step of any new increment**, before
  writing any file.
- `gh` CLI path on this Windows machine (not on default bash PATH):
  `"/c/Program Files/GitHub CLI/gh.exe"`.
- Node.js path (not on default bash PATH): `export PATH="/c/Program Files/nodejs:$PATH"` before any `npm`/`node` call in the Bash tool.
- Standing instructions from the user (persistent memory, apply always):
  - Security-by-design by default, not only when asked. When security
    and a stated UX requirement conflict, hold the UX requirement
    fixed and find the *most secure option that still satisfies it* —
    don't unilaterally pick one over the other, and say so explicitly.
  - Give explicit, numbered, shell-correct (confirm bash vs
    PowerShell) step-by-step instructions when handing the user
    commands to run themselves.
  - End every turn/session by stating the concrete next step and what
    it achieves.
  - As of 2026-08-28: work continuously, no pausing for check-ins,
    until the project is done or the user says stop.
  - Always read this file and persistent memory at the start of every
    session/context reset — confirmed standing practice, not
    optional, not just something to write to.

## Architecture (condensed — full reasoning in docs/adr/0001–0007)

Monorepo, 3 services, each separately installed:

- **services/solver** — Python + OR-Tools CP-SAT. Pure in-memory
  scheduling engine, no DB/HTTP/auth. Multi-school crew scheduling
  (spec §5).
- **services/api** — Python + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic. Owns
  persistence, RBAC, audit. Calls solver **in-process** (library call,
  not network).
- **services/web** — React 19 + TypeScript + Vite. Dispatcher console.
  oxlint (not ESLint) + Prettier. Vitest + React Testing Library.

**Gotchas that will bite again if forgotten:**

1. `services/api` imports `isd_solver` directly but does **not**
   declare it as a pyproject dependency (no portable monorepo
   path-dependency solution exists for pip). **Solver must always be
   installed before api** — README, CI (`ci.yml`'s `api` job runs
   `pip install -e ../solver` first), and any local setup. Broke CI
   once already (PR #7) when forgotten.
2. mypy + numpy: `ortools` pulls in `numpy` transitively. A newer
   numpy can ship `.pyi` stubs using Python-3.12-only syntax that
   breaks mypy under this project's `python_version="3.11"` target —
   a **parse-time** error. Per-module `ignore_errors`/
   `follow_imports="skip"` targeted at `numpy`/`numpy.*` does **not**
   suppress it (verified empirically, twice). Working fix: solver uses
   a **global** `follow_imports="skip"` in `[tool.mypy]` (safe —
   `packages=["isd_solver"]` exempts its own code from it); api uses a
   **targeted override on `ortools`/`ortools.*`** (not numpy) with
   `follow_imports="skip"`, cutting the chain before numpy while still
   fully type-checking `isd_solver`'s real API (verified both
   directions with deliberate-error sanity tests). If this resurfaces
   on a future dependency bump, apply the same pattern.
3. Windows: `core.autocrlf=true` (Git for Windows default) + no
   `.gitattributes` (fixed now, PR #7) meant local files checked out
   CRLF while the repo stores LF, which made `prettier --check` fail
   on every file locally (not in CI, which runs on Linux). If a wall
   of prettier failures appears that doesn't match reality, check
   `.gitattributes` survived and `git config core.autocrlf`.
4. Docker: a named volume's mount point is created **owned by root**
   by default — if the container drops to a non-root `USER` before any
   volume is attached (as `services/api/Dockerfile` does), writes to
   that mount fail. Fix applied: `mkdir -p /data && chown -R appuser
   /data` *before* `USER appuser`. If a future volume mount is added,
   apply the same pattern.
5. docker-compose: `VAR: ${VAR:-default}` syntax **always sets** the
   env var in the container (to `default`, or `""` if `default` is
   empty) — it does not mean "leave unset so the app's own fallback
   applies." Setting `ISD_API_JWT_SECRET_KEY: ${ISD_API_JWT_SECRET_KEY:-}`
   passed a genuinely empty string into the container, which
   pydantic-settings read as a real (invalid) value instead of falling
   back to its own default — broke login with a 500
   ("HMAC key must not be empty"). Fix: don't list a compose env var
   at all when the intent is "let the app's own default apply."

**Auth (revised mid-session — see PR #6):** httpOnly, `SameSite=Lax`
session cookie (`isd_session`), sliding 30-min inactivity renewal
(`get_current_user` renews Max-Age on every cookie-authenticated
request), 12h absolute cap (JWT `exp` fixed at login, unaffected by
renewal). Separate from the still-unchanged bearer-token JSON response
(60min, used by tests/Swagger/scripts) — additive, not a replacement.
Frontend **never** touches the token — auth state is just "did
`GET /users/me` succeed". CORS: explicit origin allowlist (never
wildcard) + `allow_credentials=True`. Original plan was an in-memory
token; user required refresh-survival + inactivity-logout, cookie
approach is the (more secure) resolution.

**DB:** SQLite dev (`services/api/isd_api_dev.db`, gitignored),
PostgreSQL+PostGIS is the stated production target (unused so far — no
Postgres environment exists here). `make_engine()` in `db.py` is the
single source of truth for engine construction (app/tests/bootstrap
script all use it — don't hand-roll a second one).

**Solver↔API boundary:** `services/api/src/isd_api/routers/schedule.py`
— `_to_solver_inputs` builds solver domain objects from DB rows;
`_hard_constraint_violation` re-validates hard constraints for manual
PATCH edits that bypass the solver.

## Status by phase (condensed — full detail in docs/architecture.md)

- **Phase 0** (domain model + ADRs) — Done.
- **Phase 1** (solver MVP) — Done, hardened. 30/30 tests.
- **Phase 2** (persistence + RBAC) — Done. Includes mutation endpoints
  (`PATCH`/`DELETE /schedule/assignments/{id}`, `Assignment.locked` +
  lock-aware re-solve with **partial-day crew availability** — locking
  one assignment only excludes that time range on that crew, not the
  crew's whole day, via `Crew.busy_intervals`), `Driver.max_continuous_minutes`
  enforced as a real CP-SAT hard constraint, ADR 0007 (integrations
  boundary decision, no code yet).
- **Phase 3** (dispatcher console) — **DONE** for its own defined
  scope: login (cookie session), `/schedule` page (run/re-run solver,
  view assignments joined to school/driver/vehicle, lock/unlock,
  delete, crew-reassignment dropdown, **inline crew+run creation for
  the selected date**), `/setup` page (create/list schools,
  qualifications, drivers, vehicles — admin-only creation, RBAC-
  verified live with a real dispatcher-role user). Console is usable
  end to end with **zero raw API calls needed**. Dockerized (both
  images build+run+pass a CI smoke test). "Other roles" is *not* a
  Phase 3 gap — driver app is Phase 4, parent/student is Phase 5, each
  its own phase in the original roadmap.
- **Phase 4** (driver app) — **MVP done** (PR #13, ADR 0008: responsive
  web app in `services/web`, not native — see ADR 0008 for the full
  reasoning, including why this doesn't foreclose a native client
  later). `/driver` page: today's own runs with resolved school/vehicle
  names (`GET /schedule/{date}/my-assignments`, denormalized/driver-
  scoped rather than broadening the admin-only `/runs`,`/crews`,
  `/drivers` endpoints), mark started/completed/no-show (`PATCH
  /schedule/assignments/{id}/status`, audited), native `SpeechSynthesis`
  "read aloud" (spec §9). Role-aware nav (`AppLayout`) and root-redirect
  (`RoleHome` in `App.tsx`). **Along the way fixed a real bug**:
  `LoginPage.tsx` hardcoded its post-login redirect to `/schedule` —
  broke for a driver login now that one exists (found via manual
  browser testing, not by inspection — see the project's own precedent
  of catching real bugs this way). Not yet: parent/student views (Phase
  5), absence reporting, GPS/live position (ADR 0007, Phase 6+),
  offline support.
- **Phases 5–6** — Not started (parent/student app, dynamic
  rerouting/substitutes/field trips/historical learning).
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, 4 jobs (solver/api/web/docker),
  runs on every push to `main` and every PR. PR #13 pushed; watch for
  green before merging (see "Exact next step").

## Exact next step (as of this checkpoint)

Phase 4's client-platform decision is resolved (ADR 0008: responsive
web app, user confirmed) and its MVP is built and pushed as
[PR #13](https://github.com/giddy-mpungu/isd-bus-routing/pull/13)
(`feat/phase4-driver-app-mvp`), verified locally (47 api tests, 27 web
tests, migration up/down/up, and a full manual browser pass logged in
as both a seeded driver and the admin — see PR body for the checklist).
**CI passed all 5 checks on PR #13** (verified via `gh pr checks 13
--watch`, not just assumed). Merging now: `gh pr merge 13 --merge
--delete-branch`, then sync local `main`. If this file is being read
because that merge didn't happen yet for some reason, do it first,
then update this file's PR #13 line and persistent memory
(`project_isd_bus_routing_overview.md`) the same way every prior
merged PR was recorded.

**After PR #13 lands, no known gap is blocking further work.** What's
left in `docs/architecture.md`'s gap list is either genuinely deferred
to a later phase (student/stop entities — Phase 5; field trips/
absences — Phase 6) or an integrations boundary with nothing concrete
to build against yet (ADR 0007). Reasonable next candidates, roughly
in order of how directly they extend what's just shipped:

- Phase 4 follow-ups the MVP intentionally left out (see ADR 0008 /
  architecture.md's Phase 4 row): absence reporting, GPS/live
  position (would need ADR 0007's "streamed telemetry" shape built for
  real), offline support.
- Phase 5 (parent/student app) — a new phase, needs its own scoping
  pass the way this session did for Phase 3 and Phase 4 (see the
  `EnterPlanMode` plan this PR was built from as a template for that
  process).
- The minor, non-blocking polish items noted since PR #12 and still
  true: no SQLAlchemy 2.0 mypy plugin (ORM constructor kwargs aren't
  strictly type-checked); no rate limiting on `POST /auth/login`; no
  refresh-token/revocation mechanism (ADR 0006 follow-ups).

None of these were asked for — don't start one without checking
whether the user actually wants it over continuing toward Phase 5.

## Environment specifics (this machine)

- Windows; PowerShell primary, git-bash for the Bash tool (separate
  PATH, separate line-ending behavior — see gotchas above).
- Python 3.12 (Windows Store install). numpy currently pinned at
  2.5.2 locally (deliberately upgraded mid-session to match CI's
  fresh resolution and reproduce/fix the mypy bug for real, not just
  in theory).
- Dev servers: `python -m uvicorn isd_api.main:app --port 8000` (from
  `services/api`) + `npm run dev` (from `services/web`, port 5173,
  needs the node PATH export above). Both started via the Bash tool
  with `run_in_background: true`, stopped via `TaskStop` when done.
- Manual browser testing via `mcp__Claude_Browser__*` tools. Working
  pattern: `preview_start` → `read_page` (not `screenshot` — the pane
  is often hidden/times out) → `form_input` for text fields →
  `computer` `left_click` with a `ref` for buttons (works once the tab
  is fronted via `tabs_select` if the pane was hidden) → `tabs_close` +
  `TaskStop` cleanup at the end.
- Local dev DB was reset during Phase 4 work (`rm isd_api_dev.db` +
  `alembic upgrade head` + `bootstrap_admin.py`) — the Phase 3-era
  seed users/data noted in earlier revisions of this file no longer
  exist. Current dev DB has: admin `admin@example.org` /
  `adminpass123` (`transportation_admin`); driver login
  `driver1@example.org` / `driverpass123` (linked to a seeded `Driver`
  row); one school ("Riverside Elementary"), one crew, one run/
  assignment for the day this was seeded — used for the Phase 4
  manual verification pass. Treat this as scratch data, not a fixture
  to build on; reseed or reset as needed.
- `.claude/launch.json` (gitignored, not repo-tracked) has an
  `isd-web` entry pointing at `http://localhost:5173` for the Browser
  tool's `preview_start` — if a Vite dev server is already running on
  that port from a prior turn, `preview_start` attaches to it instead
  of starting a new one (`"url"` config, no `runtimeExecutable`).

## Memory system

Persistent cross-session memory lives at
`C:\Users\gmbug\.claude\projects\D--Projects-isd-bus-routing\memory\`
(`MEMORY.md` index + per-topic files) — that's a **different**,
complementary mechanism to this file: private to Claude, not
repo-tracked. This file is repo-tracked so it survives even without
access to that memory directory (a fresh branch, a different machine,
a clone). Keep both updated; they should never contradict each other.
